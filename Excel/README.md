## Goal
- My goal with this Excel project was to create a clear, ***easy-to-use overview of key bank loan metrics*** like ***loan balances, interest rates, and default rates*** so that anyone can quickly spot trends, gauge risk, and make informed decisions. By focusing on the most important factors, I aimed to show how an interactive dashboard can provide a quick snapshot of a bank’s overall loan performance and highlight areas for potential improvement.
## Description
- I built this Bank Loan Dashboard in ***Excel*** to practice transforming raw financial data into actionable insights. It uses ***pivot tables, charts, and interactive filters*** to highlight patterns and outliers across various loan categories. By ***integrating multiple data sources and formulas***, the dashboard accurately displays ***loan health, repayment behaviors, and portfolio growth***. This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world financial data in Excel and present it in a way that supports ***data-driven decision-making***.

## Analysis

- Measures such as ***Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI*** helps to understand how various factors drive overall loan performance. By ***visualizing monthly loan applications***, I can spot trends and potential seasonal fluctuations, while the ***map view*** reveals how different regions compare in terms of total loan requests. Additionally, ***breaking down applications by purpose, term length, and home ownership*** helps pinpoint the types of borrowers and loans contributing most to the portfolio. Together, these metrics offer a clear snapshot of lending patterns and help highlight opportunities.

- I set up several ***pivot tables and charts*** in Excel to get a clear view of loan performance across different categories—like ***loan amounts, application counts, and interest rates***. By breaking down the data by ***month, region, and loan purpose***, I can quickly spot patterns and figure out which segments drive the most loan activity or carry ***higher risk***.
