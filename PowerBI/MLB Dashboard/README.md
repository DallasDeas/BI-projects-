## Goal
- The goal of this MLB Payroll Dashboard is to provide an in-depth overview of ***team payroll spending***, enabling stakeholders to understand how financial investments correlate with team performance. It offers clear insights into ***payroll distributions***, ***spending trends***, and ***cost efficiency***, supporting ***strategic decision-making*** in sports finance.
## Description
- This MLB Payroll Dashboard was built using Power BI to analyze key financial metrics associated with team payrolls. I focused on using ***interactive visualizations***, ***detailed charts***, and ***drill-down & tooltip*** capabilities to present payroll data in a meaningful way. By leveraging ***DAX calculations*** and ***Power Query transformations***, the dashboard ensures data accuracy and ***dynamic reporting***.

- The dashboard reveals trends in ***payroll allocation over time***, ***compares spending across teams***, and ***explores the relationship between payroll investment and team performance***. Users can dive into specific segments to assess cost efficiency and understand budgeting strategies within Major League Baseball.

- This project reflects my ability to merge financial analysis with sports data, delivering actionable insights that support ***data-driven decisions***.

## Analysis

- I created measures like ***AvgCostPerWin***, ***CostPerWin***, and ***WinLossRatio*** to see how each MLB team’s payroll translates into performance on the field. By identifying the ***CheapestTeam and MostExpensiveTeam***, I can highlight spending differences across the league, while metrics such as ***Win% and WinRatioTarget*** show how those investments pay off. Together with details like ***Average Age, Total Payroll Allocations, and Postseason appearances***, these measures paint a clear picture of how financial decisions influence a team’s success.

- This ***Drill-Down*** is designed to provide a quick, in-depth look at any of the MLB team's performance within the larger MLB dashboard. By right-clicking on any of the team's data, end users can see details like the ***Win Loss Ratio & Target Goal, Win Percentage, and Cost Per Win***. The gauge indicates how close the team is to its ***win-loss target***, the ***Win Percentage*** shows their ***overall success rate, and the Cost Per Win highlights financial efficiency***. A ***historical line chart*** displays yearly wins and losses, giving context to their long-term trends.

- This ***tooltip page (1 of 2)*** shows a bar chart ***comparing the total number of wins and losses*** across various MLB teams. It offers a quick way to see which franchises have historically dominated in wins or struggled with losses. By hovering over specific points in the main dashboard, users can instantly access these ***team-by-team totals***, making it easier to spot trends and compare overall performance at a glance.
