## Goal
- The goal of this MLB Payroll Dashboard is to provide an in-depth overview of ***team payroll spending***, enabling stakeholders to understand how financial investments correlate with team performance. It offers clear insights into ***payroll distributions***, ***spending trends***, and ***cost efficiency***, supporting ***strategic decision-making*** in sports finance.
## Description
- This MLB Payroll Dashboard was built using Power BI to analyze key financial metrics associated with team payrolls. I focused on using ***interactive visualizations***, ***detailed charts***, and ***drill-down & tooltip*** capabilities to present payroll data in a meaningful way. By leveraging ***DAX calculations*** and ***Power Query transformations***, the dashboard ensures data accuracy and ***dynamic reporting***.

- The dashboard reveals trends in ***payroll allocation over time***, ***compares spending across teams***, and ***explores the relationship between payroll investment and team performance***. Users can dive into specific segments to assess cost efficiency and understand budgeting strategies within Major League Baseball.

- This project reflects my ability to merge financial analysis with sports data, delivering actionable insights that support ***data-driven decisions***.
